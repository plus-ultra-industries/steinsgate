# Epic #1: [EPIC] Steinsgate v1 — AI QA Copilot for Agencies (React + Inertia)

## Goal
Build Steinsgate v1 as an AI QA Copilot for agencies using React + Inertia, with all implementation work generated and executed by DarkForge workflows.

## Non-negotiable process
- This epic is the only manually created planning artifact.
- Task breakdown must be generated by workflows (PM -> TPM -> Architect -> Engineer -> Review -> QA -> Docs).
- If breakdown does not happen automatically, treat that as a DarkForge gap to fix.

## Product intent
Agencies can run automated QA checks on client websites and get reproducible bug reports with screenshots, severity, and clear repro steps.

## Initial scope expectations (to be refined by workflows)
- Project + environment setup
- QA run orchestration
- Browser-based checks
- Findings dashboard
- Export/shareable bug report format
- QA approval gate before merge

## Technical constraints
- App stack: Elixir + React + Inertia
- Workflow-first execution (issue-driven)

## Success criteria
- Workflows autonomously expand this epic into role-specific issues/tasks.
- At least one end-to-end slice goes from planning -> implementation -> review -> QA -> merge -> docs ticket without manual decomposition.

## Notes
This epic intentionally validates the DarkForge orchestration quality. If autonomous decomposition fails, prioritize improving DarkForge over manual fallback.
