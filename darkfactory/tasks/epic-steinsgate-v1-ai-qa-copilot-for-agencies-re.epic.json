  "body": "## Goal\nBuild Steinsgate v1 as an AI QA Copilot for agencies using React + Inertia, with all implementation work generated and executed by DarkForge workflows.\n\n## Non-negotiable process\n- This epic is the only manually created planning artifact.\n- Task breakdown must be generated by workflows (PM -> TPM -> Architect -> Engineer -> Review -> QA -> Docs).\n- If breakdown does not happen automatically, treat that as a DarkForge gap to fix.\n\n## Product intent\nAgencies can run automated QA checks on client websites and get reproducible bug reports with screenshots, severity, and clear repro steps.\n\n## Initial scope expectations (to be refined by workflows)\n- Project + environment setup\n- QA run orchestration\n- Browser-based checks\n- Findings dashboard\n- Export/shareable bug report format\n- QA approval gate before merge\n\n## Technical constraints\n- App stack: Elixir + React + Inertia\n- Workflow-first execution (issue-driven)\n\n## Success criteria\n- Workflows autonomously expand this epic into role-specific issues/tasks.\n- At least one end-to-end slice goes from planning -> implementation -> review -> QA -> merge -> docs ticket without manual decomposition.\n\n## Notes\nThis epic intentionally validates the DarkForge orchestration quality. If autonomous decomposition fails, prioritize improving DarkForge over manual fallback.",
